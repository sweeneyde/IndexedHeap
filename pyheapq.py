# The child indices of heap index pos are already heaps, and we want to make
# a heap at index pos too.  We do this by bubbling the smaller child of
# pos up (and so on with that child's children, etc) until hitting a leaf,
# then using _siftdown to move the oddball originally at index pos into place.
#
# We *could* break out of the loop as soon as we find a pos where newitem <=
# both its children, but turns out that's not a good idea, and despite that
# many books write the algorithm that way.  During a heap pop, the last array
# element is sifted in, and that tends to be large, so that comparing it
# against values starting from the root usually doesn't pay (= usually doesn't
# get us out of the loop early).  See Knuth, Volume 3, where this is
# explained and quantified in an exercise.
#
# Cutting the # of comparisons is important, since these routines have no
# way to extract "the priority" from an array element, so that intelligence
# is likely to be hiding in custom comparison methods, or in array elements
# storing (priority, record) tuples.  Comparisons are thus potentially
# expensive.
#
# On random arrays of length 1000, making this change cut the number of
# comparisons made by heapify() a little, and those made by exhaustive
# heappop() a lot, in accord with theory.  Here are typical results from 3
# runs (3 just to demonstrate how small the variance is):
#
# Compares needed by heapify     Compares needed by 1000 heappops
# --------------------------     --------------------------------
# 1837 cut to 1663               14996 cut to 8680
# 1855 cut to 1659               14966 cut to 8678
# 1847 cut to 1660               15024 cut to 8703
#
# Building the heap by using heappush() 1000 times instead required
# 2198, 2148, and 2219 compares:  heapify() is more efficient, when
# you can use it.
#
# The total compares needed by list.sort() on the same lists were 8627,
# 8627, and 8632 (this should be compared to the sum of heapify() and
# heappop() compares):  list.sort() is (unsurprisingly!) more efficient
